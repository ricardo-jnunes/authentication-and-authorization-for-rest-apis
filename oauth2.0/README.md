# OAuth 2.0

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.  This specification replaces and obsoletes the OAuth 1.0 protocol described in RFC 5849.


### Principles of OAuth2.0
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication protocol. As such, it is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of resources, for example, remote APIs or user data.

OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens. An Access Token is a piece of data that represents the authorization to access resources on behalf of the end-user. OAuth 2.0 doesnâ€™t define a specific format for Access Tokens. However, in some contexts, the JSON Web Token (JWT) format is often used. This enables token issuers to include data in the token itself. Also, for security reasons, Access Tokens may have an expiration date.

This specification is designed for use with HTTP.

###Roles
The interaction between the authorization server and resource server is beyond the scope of this specification.

The authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.

A single authorization server may issue access tokens accepted by multiple resource servers.

##### resource owner
An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.

##### resource server
The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

##### client
An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).

##### authorization server
The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
